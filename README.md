# Overview

Welcome to the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)](https://envirodatagov.org/) Government Data Archiving technical team. We are building online tools, helping events, and creating research networks to proactively preserve, archive and track public environmental data and ensure its continued availability. We are indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports. Our focus has turned to using machine learning to sift through millions of government web pages to find the most important changes as well as working with the protocols for resilient, sustainable, distributed data storage networks. This repository is an overview for people who are getting involved in the project.

Our GitHub organization, chat, and in-person events have a [Code of Conduct](./CONDUCT.md) and [Contributor Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

We are looking forward to working together! You can get started by:

- :speech_balloon: Joining the [Archivers Slack](https://archivers-slack.herokuapp.com/) and join `#dev` and `#dev-webmonitoring`
- :clipboard: Reviewing the [**web-monitoring**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring) repo, in particular read about the [project architecture](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring#architecture)
- :bookmark_tabs: Looking at our issue tracker, for the global sprint we are targeting `mozsprint` or `first-timer` issues:

## Projects

The EDGI technical team is currently supporting development of the following projects. Overall progress is tracked via our [Project Tracking Board](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/projects/2), however specific tasks, issues and milestones are handled in individual repos.

### Data Preservation

| Tool Name | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [**Archivers.space App**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/archivers.space) | [Heroku app](https://www.archivers.space/) for research and harvesting | **Working** |
| [**Harvesting Tools**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/harvesting-tools) | A collection of code snippets designed to be dropped into the data harvesting process directly after generating the zip starter kit | **Working** |
| [**Nomination Tool**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/eot-nomination-tool) | Chrome extension to simplify the nomination process at archiv-a-thons | **Working** |
| [**DataRefuge's Event Workflow**](https://github.com/datarefuge/workflow) | Detailed descriptions of the phases of event workflow | **Working** |
| [**Technical Guides**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/guides) | Technical guides for how to preserve and hold data | **Working** |
| [**DataRescueTEMPLATE**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/DataRescueTEMPLATE) | DataRescue Event Template with `gh-pages` branch for event website | **Working** |
| [**Zip Starter**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/zip-starter) | Automate zip folder creation for Harvesting during pipeline | **Working** |
| [**s3 Upload Server**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/s3-upload-server) | Heroku app for uploading Datasets to S3 from the browser  | **Working** |
| [**EIS WARC Archiver**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/eis-WARC-archiver) | Docker app that ingests a list of URLs then crawls and generates WARCs | **Working** |

### Monitoring Websites

These repositories support the current workflow, based on Google spreadsheets automatically generated from scraping the Verionista web interface. They will be deprecated when a web app-based workflow is ready to use:

| Tool Name | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [**Versionista Outputter**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/versionista-outputter) | A Ruby script that scrapes Versionista's web interface to generate a csv summarizing which websites and pages have had recent changes | **Working** |
| [**Version Tracking UI**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/version-tracking-ui) | Tools to facilitate the tracking website changes | **Archived** |

These repositories will support a future workflow that improves upon the current one by:
* replacing the Google spreadsheets with a custom web app
* drawing on data from multiple sources including Versionista, PageFreezer, and others in the future
* applying text processing techniques to prioritize and filter diffs before presenting them to human volunteers

The timing of the change-over depends on some external factors but is roughly planned for late March.

| Tool Name | Description | Status | Language |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| [**web-monitoring**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring) | Documentation and project management repo for Website Monitoring project | **Working** | `--` |
| [**web-monitoring-processing**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing) | Queries data sources, performs prioritization/filtering, populates databases for web app| **In Progress** | Python |
| [**web-monitoring-db**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db) | The Rails backend of the web app that human volunteers will use to evaluate diffs | **In Progress** | Ruby on Rails |
| [**web-monitoring-ui**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ui) | The JS front-end that human volunteers will use to evaluate diffs | **In Progress** | TypeScript |
| [**web-monitoring-versionista-scraper**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-versionista-scraper) | Node.js scraper for Versionista data | **Working** | Node |
