# Google Summer of Code

This is the ideas page for EDGI's Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program!

All newcomers to the project should review our [project introduction](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/) to learn more about where and how we work. Our repositories can be found on our [Github organization page](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/).

**Important Note**--to learn how to contribute to EDGI software, see our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Contact Us

Most development communication happens on [archivers.slack.com](https://archivers.slack.com/), where anyone can [request an invite](https://archivers-slack.herokuapp.com/). Matt Price ( [@titaniumbones](https://github.com/titaniumbones) | @mattprice) is the technical lead for the project.

For project-related topics, reach out on Slack at `#dev`, or file an issue in the appropriate Github repo. 

For GSoC application inquiries, use the `#gsoc` channel.

## Contribute Improvements

We have [preferred guidelines](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for submitting changes. Please read them over!

We also love it when students show that they are excited to work with us by looking at some of our `first-timer` issues in our [pagefreezer-cli](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/pagefreezer-cli/labels/first-timer) or [guides](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/guides/labels/first-timer) repos and even submitting a pull request! This gives us confidence that you've read our contribution guidelines and would be ready to jump into a project.

## Submit a Proposal!

If you are interested in being a [GSoC student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/) with us, first read through our oganization profile, join the `#gsoc` channel in our slack, and tell us what you're interested in working on and a bit about your experience.  

It's also great to hear if you've forked one of our codebases and set up a development environment. Done with that? How about running tests? Tell us how far you've gotten!

Once your idea is more developed, please fork this repo and submit a PR to [`overview/gsoc`](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/gsoc) with the name `proposal-lastname.md` describing your proposal in detail based off of the [template](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/gsoc/gsoc-template.md) for proposals.

# Potential Ideas

## Apply Machine Learning to Monitoring Website Changes
- **Part of:** [pagefreezer-cli](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/pagefreezer-cli/)   
- **Description:** Help us improve our government agency website monitoring through the use of machine learning in order to develop an interface where analysts can computer-assisted identification of important changes.   
- **Contact:** `#dev` on [archivers.slack.com](https://archivers.slack.com/)   
- **Keywords:** new features, machine learning, data analysis, visualization
- **Ideal Experience and Interest:** Python, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), Machine Learning (tools like [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) or MATLAB's machine learning).   

The pagefreezer-cli has had 4 months of development and interacs with the API from our partner organization to pull down and compare changes in versions of webpages on the domains we monitor. We are looking to move into supporting the analyst's task of comparing and determining important changes through the application of machine learning models.


## Refine Event-based Preservation Application

- **Part of:** [pipeline and harvesting-tools](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/harvesting-tools)   
- **Description:** We have a backlog of feature requests and a growing application to handle event-based preservation and data downloading. Features we're keen for include improving our leaderboard so we can see how volunteers are doing at events, making our interface cleaner and easier to understand, and more.   
- **Contact:** `#dev` on [archivers.slack.com](https://archivers.slack.com/)   
- **Keywords:** new features, optimization, security, web application, visualization
- **Ideal Experience and Interest:** JavaScript ([Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)), Heroku, AWS, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Our pipeline app and harvesting-tools are the most mature of our projects, but have a fair bit of refining before they are really stable. Also-- we've got ongoing research and questions around best practises in web security. We have short cycles of development, use, feedback, and refinement so if you are interested in learning more about web application security and developlment in an agile-inspired development process this might be for you!
